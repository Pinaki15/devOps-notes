Webserver is used to host the webpages. Without web server, u wont be able to see web-page

Microservices are deployed as images into containers like Docker. All we need to do is run the image to create containers

HOW TO CREATE CONTAINERS??
- take a VM - EC2 instance
- install container engine. EX-docker

DOCKER ARCHITECTURE
- we have a client and server.
- we type commands on the client
- Information goes to the server(docker daemon) using REST API and docker daemon does all the work and sends response back to the client
- Docker is developed in go language
- We need to have image of the container, run the image to create conatiners
- 

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VIRTUAL MACHINE AND CONTAINER?
- Since container engine virtualizes host OS, we can leverage host OS with all containers.
- In virtualization we install hypervisor, or any virtualization software to create virtual machines which have their own OS
- In virtualization, virtualiation is done on physical server so we need separate OS on each of vm's but in container virtualization 
  is happenning at the host OS where we can leverage host OS for containers.
- IN containers, host OS has to be LINUX, on windows we cannot do containers
  
TO PULL IMAGE FROM DOCKER HUB
docker pull <image-name>

TO SEE RUNNING CONTAINERS
docker ps

TO RUN A CONTAINER
docker run <image-name>

TO INSPECT IMAGE
docker inspect <image-name>

PORT MAPPING TO ACCESS A CONTAINER TO CREATE A BRIDGE BETWEEN HOST AND CONTAINER
docker run -itd -p 82:80 httpd  {-p is for port mapping, to specify ports
                                 -it stands for interactive which we need to use to go inside container and execute commands
                                 -d stands for detached which we use becoz we need container to be running even if I am not inside container
                                }

TO GO INSIDE CONTAINER
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash

TO SAVE CONTAINER AS AN IMAGE
docker commit <container-id> <name-u-wanttogive-to-image>  {ex-docker commit ccd9990 newImage}

TO CHECK IF APACHE2 SERVICE IS RUNNING
service apache2 status

TO START APACHE2 SERVICE
service apache2 start

TO RENAME A DOCKER IMAGE
docker tag <current-image-name> <docker-userid>/<new-image-name>

TO PUSH TO DOCKER HUB
docker login
docker push <image-name>
